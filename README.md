# Parameter Tracking with Machine Learning
Codes for ''Machine-learning parameter tracking with partial state observation'', a manuscript submitted to Physical Review Research.

# Example

Run ''params_extraction.m'' to get the ground truth and tracked paramter variations of the food chain system:

Change ''system'' to others to track parameters of different systems, e.g., system = 'mg';
